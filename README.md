🛡️ Threat Intelligence & Hunting Lab with Microsoft Sentinel

In this hands-on lab, I collected IOCs (indicators of compromise) from open-source threat intelligence feeds. I used KQL within Microsoft Sentinel to proactively hunt for threats in the `SecurityEvents` table. This exercise simulated core SOC workflows, including:

- ✴️ Correlating event data with external threat intel
- 🔍 Identifying anomalous activity through custom queries
- 🕵️ Surfacing potential threats that bypass standard alerting

By focusing on proactive hunting rather than reactive alert triage, this lab highlights how to reduce dwell time and strengthen detection coverage in a modern SOC environment. The documented queries, sample IOCs, and hunting process aim to support other practitioners building similar labs or training workflows.
